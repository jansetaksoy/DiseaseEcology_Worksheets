The epidemiological triad is a model used to understand how diseases happen. It includes three parts: the **pathogen** (what causes the disease, like a virus or bacteria), the **host** (the person or animal that can get sick), and the **environment** (the surroundings that make it easier or harder for the disease to spread). Disease occurs when the agent, host, and environment interact in a way that allows infection.
