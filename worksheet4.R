Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The epidemiological triad is a model used to understand how diseases happen. It includes three parts: the **pathogen** (what causes the disease, like a virus or bacteria), the **host** (the person or animal that can get sick), and the **environment** (the surroundings that make it easier or harder for the disease to spread). Disease occurs when the agent, host, and environment interact in a way that allows infection.

**Question**: Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer with 95% confidence.

**59 samples** 

**Question**: Compare sample size requirements for two scenarios using hypergeometric distribution.

-   **Scenario a** (95% confidence, 1% prevalence, large population): **299 samples**

-   **Scenario b** (99% confidence, 2% prevalence, large population): **228 samples** 

**Question**: You sample 300 deer from a facility with 4000 total deer. None test positive for EHD antibodies. Complete: "you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%."

a)  **Question:** Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

    **Incidence on 06/12/25:**

    New cases: 5 elk (2320B, 2763B, 2772B, 4597B, 6001B)

    -   Susceptible population: 9 elk (those not infected on 06/11/25)

    -   **Incidence = 5/9 = 0.5556 cases per susceptible animal per day**

    **Incidence on 06/14/25:**

    -   New cases: 2 elk (1766B, 4599B)

    -   Susceptible population: 2 elk (those not infected on 06/13/25)

    -   **Incidence = 2/2 = 1.0000 cases per susceptible animal per day**

    **Incidence on 06/15/25:**

    -   New cases: 0 elk (no new infections occurred)

    -   Susceptible population: 3 elk (those not infected on 06/14/25)

    -   **Incidence = 0/3 = 0.0000 cases per susceptible animal per day**

    **Unit for incidence:** cases per susceptible animal per day

**Question:** What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

**Prevalence on 06/13/25:**

-   Existing cases: 12 elk showing symptoms (RE, OD, or both)

-   Total population: 14 tracked elk

-   **Prevalence = 12/14 = 0.8571**

**Prevalence on 06/16/25:**

-   Existing cases: 5 elk still showing symptoms

-   Total population: 14 tracked elk

-   **Prevalence = 5/14 = 0.3571**

**Unit for prevalence:** proportion of population infected

**Question:** On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

Answer: 06/10/25

-   Prevalence = 1/14 = 0.0714 (1 infected elk out of 14 total)

-   Incidence = 1/14 = 0.0714 (1 new case out of 14 susceptible elk)

**Question:** On which day is the incidence lowest?

The incidence of conjunctivitis in Jan’s elk herd was lowest on 06/15/25 and 06/16/25, with zero new cases reported on both days.

Worksheet 4

Mers-CoV is primarilly maintained in human populations
	Incorrect, the virus is mostly found in camels

Camels serve as the main animal reservoir fot MERS-CoV.
	Correct

Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV
	Yes

The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%.
	Incorrect, the death rate is about 35%.
	
The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak.
	Incorrect, the curve does not show a single outbreal point; it shows repeated spikes over many years
