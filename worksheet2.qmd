Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

The epidemiological triad is a model used to understand how diseases happen. It includes three parts: the **pathogen** (what causes the disease, like a virus or bacteria), the **host** (the person or animal that can get sick), and the **environment** (the surroundings that make it easier or harder for the disease to spread). Disease occurs when the agent, host, and environment interact in a way that allows infection.

**Question**: Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer with 95% confidence.

**59 samples** 

**Question**: Compare sample size requirements for two scenarios using hypergeometric distribution.

-   **Scenario a** (95% confidence, 1% prevalence, large population): **299 samples**

-   **Scenario b** (99% confidence, 2% prevalence, large population): **228 samples** 

**Question**: You sample 300 deer from a facility with 4000 total deer. None test positive for EHD antibodies. Complete: "you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\_ (\<, =, \>) \_\_\_\_%."

**\< 1.0%**
