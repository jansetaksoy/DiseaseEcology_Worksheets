The epidemiological triad is a model used to understand how diseases happen. It includes three parts: the **pathogen** (what causes the disease, like a virus or bacteria), the **host** (the person or animal that can get sick), and the **environment** (the surroundings that make it easier or harder for the disease to spread). Disease occurs when the agent, host, and environment interact in a way that allows infection.

a)  **Question:** Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.

    **Incidence on 06/12/25:**

    New cases: 5 elk (2320B, 2763B, 2772B, 4597B, 6001B)

    -   Susceptible population: 9 elk (those not infected on 06/11/25)

    -   **Incidence = 5/9 = 0.5556 cases per susceptible animal per day**

    **Incidence on 06/14/25:**

    -   New cases: 2 elk (1766B, 4599B)

    -   Susceptible population: 2 elk (those not infected on 06/13/25)

    -   **Incidence = 2/2 = 1.0000 cases per susceptible animal per day**

    **Incidence on 06/15/25:**

    -   New cases: 0 elk (no new infections occurred)

    -   Susceptible population: 3 elk (those not infected on 06/14/25)

    -   **Incidence = 0/3 = 0.0000 cases per susceptible animal per day**

    **Unit for incidence:** cases per susceptible animal per day

**Question:** What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.

**Prevalence on 06/13/25:**

-   Existing cases: 12 elk showing symptoms (RE, OD, or both)

-   Total population: 14 tracked elk

-   **Prevalence = 12/14 = 0.8571**

**Prevalence on 06/16/25:**

-   Existing cases: 5 elk still showing symptoms

-   Total population: 14 tracked elk

-   **Prevalence = 5/14 = 0.3571**

**Unit for prevalence:** proportion of population infected

**Question:** On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?

Answer: 06/10/25

-   Prevalence = 1/14 = 0.0714 (1 infected elk out of 14 total)

-   Incidence = 1/14 = 0.0714 (1 new case out of 14 susceptible elk)

**Question:** On which day is the incidence lowest?

The incidence of conjunctivitis in Jan's elk herd was lowest on 6/15/25 and 6/16/25, with zero new cases reported on both days.

**Worksheet 7**
**How do the modes of transmission differ between Malaysia and Bangladesh**

A: In Malaysia (1998-1999), transmission was primarily pig-to-human through direct contact with infected pigs, which served as amplifying hosts after acquiring the virus from fruit bats. Human-to-human transmission was minimal with only two potential cases. In contrast, Bangladesh transmission involves bat-to-human (via contaminated date palm sap) and significantly human-to-human transmission (approximately 46% of cases). The Bangladesh strain produces higher respiratory viral loads, facilitating person-to-person spread through close contact.

 **How do these differences influence preventive measures in each setting?**

Malaysia focused on agricultural control through mass pig culling (over one million pigs), restricting fruit tree planting near farms, and implementing livestock biosecurity. Bangladesh prevention emphasizes behavioral and clinical measures: avoiding raw date palm sap consumption, using bamboo skirts on palm trees to exclude bats, and in healthcare settings, implementing strict barrier nursing, PPE protocols, contact tracing, isolation of cases, and enhanced environmental disinfection with adequate ventilation standards.

**What are the different transmission routes of avian reovirus?**

ARV transmits via three routes: (1) Fecal-oral (most common) through contaminated feed, water, and litter; (2) Respiratory transmission, though less frequent; and (3) Vertical transmission from infected breeders to progeny through eggs at approximately two percent rate.

**Which environmental factors favor ARV transmission?**

High bird densities facilitate rapid fecal-oral spread. ARV exhibits exceptional environmental persistence, surviving ten or more days on feathers and eggshells, and ten or more weeks in drinking water. The virus resists heat, proteolytic enzymes, pH variations, and many disinfectants. Winter and spring show higher transmission rates than summer and fall, with overcrowding at winter roosts amplifying spread.

**What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?**

The non-enveloped icosahedral capsid structure containing double-stranded RNA confers exceptional environmental stability, supporting prolonged survival and fecal-oral transmission. Vertically infected chicks shed high viral loads that rapidly spread to flockmates through contaminated droppings.

**Provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and describe its impact.**

Corvid orthoreovirus causes winter mortality in wild birds, particularly American crows, hooded crows, and magpies. Hundreds to thousands congregate at winter roosts, enabling efficient fecal-oral transmission. Clinical signs include severe hepatic and splenic necrosis, hepatitis, enteritis, and neurological symptoms. Documented outbreaks in North America and Europe cause significant mortality—hundreds of birds per event.

**What is the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus?**

The Asian house shrew (Crocidura lasiura) is the likely natural reservoir, with approximately twenty-seven percent of tested shrews positive for LayV RNA. Transmission occurs through zoonotic spillover from shrews to humans, likely via direct contact or an intermediate host. All identified cases involved farmers or factory workers with recent animal exposure.

**Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID**

LayV lacks sustained human-to-human transmission—the defining characteristic of an emerging infectious disease. Contact tracing documented no secondary human cases among close contacts, and cases show no epidemiological clustering, spatial, or temporal connections. Each case represents an independent animal-to-human jump, not maintained circulation in human populations. Without acquiring human transmission adaptations, LayV remains a dead-end spillover infection with minimal pandemic risk.

**Worksheet 8**
Overall Infection Summary

Out of 106 raccoons examined during 2013-2014, 50 were infected with B. procyonis, yielding an overall prevalence of 47.17% (95% CI: 37.93%, 56.60%). The mean worm burden across all raccoons was 4.45 worms, but among infected animals, the mean intensity was 9.44 worms (range: 1-54 worms).

Regional Prevalence Patterns

Significant regional differences were detected (Chi-square = 12.66, p = 0.0018). The three regions showed markedly different infection patterns:​

North Region: 14 of 49 raccoons infected (28.57%, 95% CI: 17.85%, 42.41%)

Central Region: 9 of 14 raccoons infected (64.29%, 95% CI: 38.76%, 83.66%)

South Region: 27 of 43 raccoons infected (62.79%, 95% CI: 47.86%, 75.62%)

The North region had significantly lower prevalence compared to both Central (p = 0.0256) and South (p = 0.0015) regions. However, Central and South regions showed no significant difference from each other (p = 1.0000). This pattern suggests that environmental or ecological factors specific to the North region may limit parasite transmission or establishment.​

Sex-Related Patterns

Overall, females had significantly higher prevalence than males across all regions combined (64.86% vs 37.68%, p = 0.0087). The odds ratio of 0.328 indicates males were about three times less likely to be infected than females.​

Regional breakdown by sex revealed:

North Region: Males 21.43% (6/28), Females 38.10% (8/21), p = 0.2219 (not significant)

Central Region: Males 44.44% (4/9), Females 100.00% (5/5), p = 0.0859 (not significant)

South Region: Males 50.00% (16/32), Females 100.00% (11/11), p = 0.0030 (significant)

The South region showed the most dramatic sex difference, where every female raccoon examined was infected. In the Central region, all females were also infected, though the small sample size (n=5) limited statistical power. This strong sex bias may reflect behavioral differences, with female raccoons potentially having higher exposure to contaminated environments, particularly during denning and kit-rearing periods when they may aggregate in latrines.​

Age Class Comparisons

Adults showed higher overall prevalence (52.17%) compared to young adults (37.84%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.2206). The odds ratio of 1.792 suggests adults were about 1.8 times more likely to be infected, consistent with cumulative exposure over time.​

Regional age patterns:

North Region: Adults 28.00% vs Young Adults 29.17% (p = 1.0000)

Central Region: Adults 61.54% vs Young Adults 100.00% (p = 1.0000, though only 1 YA sampled)

South Region: Adults 67.74% vs Young Adults 50.00% (p = 0.3126)

None of these regional differences by age were statistically significant, suggesting that in this population, age-related accumulation of infection may be less important than other factors like sex or geographic location.​

Worm Burden Analysis

Among infected raccoons, mean intensity varied by region but not significantly (Kruskal-Wallis H = 4.75, p = 0.0929):

North: Mean 3.50 worms (median 2.0, range 1-12)

Central: Mean 12.22 worms (median 4.0, range 2-51)

South: Mean 11.59 worms (median 2.0, range 1-54)

Despite similar prevalence between Central and South regions, both showed higher mean intensities than the North, though with high variability (standard deviations of 16.55 and 17.13, respectively). The highly skewed distributions (medians well below means) indicate aggregated parasite distributions, typical of helminth infections.​

Sex differences in worm burden were not significant (p = 0.1800), though infected females carried a mean of 13.96 worms compared to 5.27 in males. Similarly, age classes showed no significant difference in intensity (p = 0.7338), with adults averaging 9.19 worms and young adults 10.07 worms.

Interpretation and Ecological Context

The observed prevalence rates (28.57-64.29%) fall within the range reported for B. procyonis across North America, where prevalence can reach 90% in some areas, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast. The lower prevalence in the North region of this study area may reflect localized environmental conditions affecting egg survival or transmission dynamics.​

The striking female bias in infection, particularly the 100% prevalence in South and Central region females, is notable. B. procyonis eggs require 10-14 days to embryonate in the environment and can remain viable for years in soil. Female raccoons' latrine use patterns, potentially involving more frequent visits to communal defecation sites during reproduction and kit-rearing, could explain higher exposure.​

The lack of significant age effects suggests that exposure occurs relatively early in life, or that infection dynamics in this population may involve both acquisition and loss (through mortality or immunity), rather than simple cumulative accumulation. The high worm burdens observed in some individuals (up to 54 worms) indicate heavy environmental contamination in some areas.​

Public health implications: With nearly half of sampled raccoons infected and worm burdens sometimes exceeding 50 parasites, environmental contamination with B. procyonis eggs represents a significant zoonotic risk. The parasite causes severe neurological disease in accidental hosts, including humans, particularly children with pica or developmental disabilities. Prevention requires avoiding contact with raccoon feces, removing latrines from residential areas, and recognizing clinical signs for early treatment.​

Methodological Notes

All prevalence estimates were calculated using Wilson score confidence intervals, which provide more accurate coverage than traditional normal approximation methods, especially for proportions near 0 or 1 and with moderate sample sizes. This approach is recommended in quantitative parasitology for its robustness.

Statistical comparisons used Fisher's exact tests for 2×2 tables and Chi-square tests for multi-group comparisons of prevalence, while non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis) were employed for worm burden comparisons due to the highly skewed, aggregated distribution typical of parasite data

**Worksheet 9**
Question 1: 
Three behaviors that increased Salmonella transmission:

Kissing/cuddling poultry: Direct contact transfers bacteria from contaminated birds to human mouths and faces.​

Bringing poultry indoors: Housing birds inside homes contaminates household surfaces with fecal material, leading to cross-contamination during food handling.​

Poor hand hygiene: Failing to wash hands after handling birds allows bacteria to transfer to food and mouth.​

Question 2:

Endophyte infection provides insect resistance, drought tolerance, and improved plant survival under stress.​

b. Environmental factors driving toxicosis (4 points):

High temperature increases toxin effects​

Plant maturity stage (toxins concentrate in reproductive tissues)​

Nitrogen fertilization enhances toxin production​

Cold weather worsens lameness symptoms​

c. Key clinical signs (3 points):

Question 1: African Swine Fever Transmission (10 points)
Transmission routes:

Direct animal contact​

Contaminated feed and water​

Contaminated equipment and environments​

Soft ticks (in Africa)​

Human role in spread:
Humans spread ASF through: (1) transporting infected pork products and food waste, (2) moving contaminated clothing and equipment between farms, (3) poor biosecurity practices, and (4) illegal animal trade. Humans cannot get infected but are major disease vectors.​

Question 2: KoRV and Chlamydia Co-infection in Koalas (10 points)
Severity: KoRV infection significantly increases chlamydial disease severity, including eye, urinary, and reproductive infections.​

Progression: KoRV impairs immune function, making koalas more susceptible to persistent chlamydial infection and worse outcomes.​

Management: KoRV-infected koalas may require more intensive treatment; however, they still respond to vaccines despite the infection.​

Question 3: Snake Fungal Disease Surveillance and Management Challenges (10 points)
Key challenges:

Detection: Testing often misses infections because the fungus is unevenly distributed on snakes; requires extensive sampling.​

Variable outcomes: Some snake populations suffer high mortality; others show disease resolution with unclear long-term impacts.​

Environmental persistence: The fungus is widespread across eastern U.S.; transmission factors are poorly understood.​

Limited management: Few options for wild populations; treating individual snakes is impractical and often unsuccessful, and infected snakes exhibit behavioral changes that reduce fitness
